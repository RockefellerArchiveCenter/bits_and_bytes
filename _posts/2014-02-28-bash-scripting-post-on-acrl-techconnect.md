In case you&#8217;re interested, I wrote a [guest blog posting on the ACRL TechConnect blog](http://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/?p=4085) about some of the more technical work I&#8217;ve been up to lately. Those of you who&#8217;ve completed the [command line tutorial](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) assigned to the D-Recs committee should see some familiar commands.
