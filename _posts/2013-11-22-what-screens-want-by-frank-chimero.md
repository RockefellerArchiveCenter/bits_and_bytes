I just finished reading "[What Screens Want: some thoughts on digital canvases](http://frankchimero.com/what-screens-want/)" by [Frank Chimero](http://www.frankchimero.com/), and I highly recommend that you take a few minutes and read it too. It's short, punchy, and pretty to look at. Seriously, go ahead, do it now.
