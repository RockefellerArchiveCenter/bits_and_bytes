On February 13, 2013 the D-REC Committee attended an NISO Webinar about viewpoints and updates from industry leaders on theory and practice of preservation metadata.

The Webinar consists of presentations by [Rebecca Guenther](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2011/07/digital-pioneer-rebecca-guenther/ "Rebecca Guenther") and [Amy Kirchhoff](http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/about-us/staff/amy-j-kirchhoff "Amy Kirchhoff"). Rebecca Guenther, _Consultant and Standards specialist at the Library of Congress_, discusses the types of information that should be associated with an archival digital object, the development of the [PREMIS data dictionary](http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf "PREMIS Data Dictionary") and corresponding XML schema. Amy Kirchhoff  who is the _Archive Service Manager_ at [Portico](http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/ "Portico") details Portico’s applications of the [PREMIS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/ "PREMIS") standard to their digital preservation repositories.
