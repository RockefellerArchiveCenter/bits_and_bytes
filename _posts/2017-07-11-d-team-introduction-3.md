I am happy to introduce myself as the newest member of the RAC's D-Team! I've joined the RAC thanks to the generous support of the Ford Foundation to work on Project Electron, and to help facilitate the transfer of digital records from our donor organizations. My work will have a specific emphasis on usability and user-centered design, [a core value](http://projectelectron.rockarch.org/) of Project Electron.Â <!--more-->

A recent graduate of the Pratt School of Information MSLIS program, I've worked in non-profit, academic, and museum archives including the American Civil Liberties Union National Office Archives, the Barnard College Archives and Special Collections, the American Museum of Natural History, and am a member of the [Linked Jazz Project](http://linkedjazz.org) research team. I am particularly interested in how technology can enable archival discovery, and am excited to be part of a team whose [values](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/dteamValues/blob/master/values.md) and daily practice support the openness of and access to archival systems and materials. I look forward to working and engaging with all of the Project Electron collaborators and user communities, broadly defined, who have already contributed substantially to the project, and will hopefully benefit from and build upon our work.
