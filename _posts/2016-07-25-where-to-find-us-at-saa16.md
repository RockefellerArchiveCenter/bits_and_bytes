Like many of our archivist colleagues, the D-Team is gearing up for the [Society of American Archivists’ Annual Meeting](http://www2.archivists.org/am2016), held this year in Atlanta, Georgia. If you’re interested in catching up with us there, here are some of the things we’ll be doing:<!--more-->

Patrick will be speaking about our ArchivesSpace implementation process as well as our human-centered approach to systems implementation which seeks to involve and empower users at [_You Are Not Alone! Navigating the Implementation of New Archival Systems_](http://sched.co/6mYm). He’ll also be attending the Web Archiving, EAD Roundtable and Description Section meetings; see his complete attendance schedule [here](https://archives2016.sched.org/pjg250).

Hillel will present _Critical Work: Archivists as Maintainers_, a brief paper which looks to theorize archival labor as maintenance work, at the [10th Annual Research Forum](https://archives2016.sched.org/event/6nfu/10th-annual-saa-research-forum-foundations-and-innovations). He’ll also be participating in the [TS-DACS annual meeting](https://archives2016.sched.org/event/6ntz/saa-technical-subcommittee-on-dacs), and will play some rock and roll with archivist colleagues at the [AV Archives Night](https://archives2016.sched.org/event/7Zry/av-archives-night).

Bonnie will not be in Atlanta, because she is attending the [Code4Lib New York State conference](http://code4libnys.github.io/2016/), which overlaps with the SAA Annual Meeting. Among other sessions, she’ll be attending a session on Fedora 4 led by Esmé Cowles and Andrew Woods.
