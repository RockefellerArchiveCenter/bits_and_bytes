I wanted to let everyone know about a [new effort underway](http://www.ny3rs.org/projects/ead-repository-pilot/) in New York State to test the feasibility of a state-wide consortium for EAD finding aids. The RAC has been involved from the beginning of this project, which started with a [2011 survey](http://library.buffalo.edu/libraries/units/music/spcoll/ead/NYEADsurveysummary.html) of archives, special collections, historical societies and other institutions in New York State that hold unique materials to determine the level of EAD implementation at the state level. This survey found a very strong support for a finding aid consortium in the state.<!--more-->

A group of archivists from institutions around the state (including Cornell, Syracuse University, Vassar College, and of course the RAC) met last week in Albany to work out the details for a pilot project that will gather EAD finding aids from a variety of institutions in New York, process and load them into an XTF instance, and produce a final report that will discuss the challenges, opportunities and feasibility of continuing the project on a more long-term basis.

The six-month project is being sponsored by the [NY 3Rs Association](http://www.ny3rs.org), an organization that connects library systems in New York in an effort to better share resources and improve collaboration. Iâ€™m very excited to see how this develops in the next few months, and will continue to provide updates on this project.
