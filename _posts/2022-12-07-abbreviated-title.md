For Phase 2 of its [Culturally Competent Description Education Campaign](https://blog.rockarch.org/cultural-competency-in-archives-planning-an-education-campaign), the Rockefeller Archive Center organized a series of reading group discussions to explore how to implement workflows and policies for creating more inclusive archival description, how to make histories that have been marginalized more discoverable, and how to recognize and combat white supremacy culture in our practices. Lessons learned from organizing and facilitating conversations about culturally competent description during the [first phase of the Education Campaign](https://blog.rockarch.org/cultural-competency-in-archives-phase-one-of-the-education-campaign) influenced how Amy Berish, Katie Martin, and I approached developing the reading group sessions while increased collaboration and knowledge sharing with our colleagues expanded and invigorated the substance and scope of each discussion. The sessions’ escalating focus on the collections and practices of the RAC have made the path towards action more tangible.

## Building from Phase 1 to Phase 2

Amy, Katie, and I proposed the reading group component of the CCD Education Campaign when we devised the campaign’s project charter in the fall of 2020. Whereas the Phase 1 remote learning part of the campaign was designed to establish a shared foundation of knowledge about cultural competency practices within the framework of archives in order to give all of our colleagues an opportunity at engaging these subjects, I would say that the reading group strived to explore the possibilities for reimagining the practices and ideologies that embed and perpetuate white supremacy in archival collections and archival institutions. As the reading group sessions progressed, we continuously encouraged participants to place what they had read within the context of our institution’s collections and practices so that they could think about behaviors, actions, and projects they and their teams could implement to create change. We then finished the reading group with a session that delved into specific examples of problematic description within our own holdings.

The reading group consisted of three discussion sessions in total. These sessions convened on an almost monthly basis, and each one concerned a different reading or set of resources about inclusive archival description and other related topics in archives and allied fields. Neither attendance at the Phase 1 discussion sessions nor attendance at any previous Phase 2 reading group session were required for a staff member to attend an upcoming session if they wished to join. We remained consistent in our objective to make the education campaign open for all staff to participate and carried over some of the facilitation techniques we learned in Phase 1 like the use of the ground rules we had developed based off of the University of Minnesota’s [“Setting ground rules for productive discussions”](https://extension.umn.edu/public-engagement-strategies/setting-ground-rules-productive-discussions).

Above all else, the inclusion of guest facilitators in the reading group sessions is responsible for advancing the second phase of the education campaign from the foundations we set up in Phase 1 to bringing the RAC closer to performing reparative description actions. Amy, Katie, and I are all on the Processing Team, so incorporating the perspectives of people who interact with the RAC’s archival description in contexts outside of processing into the organization and facilitation of the reading group sessions made the discussions more impactful in a number of ways. Each facilitator brought their particular expertise and understanding of how their job intersected with the RAC’s archival description to how they approached the reading group’s content and were able to speak to colleagues in similar positions. Fortunately, we had a solid foundation of support to draw from because throughout the whole education campaign, the project received an enormous amount of commitment and engagement from across all levels and teams at the RAC. We thank our colleagues for devoting their time and efforts to delve into the reading group materials and to contribute to the discussions through listening to one another and sharing their thoughts.

From a project management standpoint, Amy, Katie, and I were also conscious of how we had underestimated the work and emotional labor involved in putting together the first phase of the education campaign. We wanted to see the CCD project progress and not disintegrate because we and our institution could not continue prioritizing it. Sharing responsibilities, nurturing stronger investment in the project, and valuing and incorporating the perspectives of our colleagues helped sustain the education campaign and ensure the prospect for future reparative description actions at the RAC.
