My name is Ima Oduok ([pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/imaoduok)) and it's a pleasure to introduce myself as the new Assistant Digital Preservation Analyst on the Digital Strategies team! In this role, I will collaborate across RAC departments to contribute to the long-term care and preservation planning of the archiveâ€™s digital collections and facilitate learning about community standards and practices in digital preservation.

My previous position was as a [resident librarian](https://www.ala.org/acrl/issues/diversityalliance) with the [Texas Digital Library (TDL)](https://www.tdl.org/), a consortium of libraries and archives based in higher education. As a digital librarian, I worked on projects supporting accessibility auditing, research on multilingual user interfaces for open-source platforms, and digital preservation. I am interested in processing and preservation practices for born-digital materials and environmental mitigation in digital preservation.
