Bonnie Gordon joined the RAC's D-Team this month and will primarily be working with born digital materials and digital preservation workflows. This includes creating disk images, viewing and interpreting them using the Forensic Toolkit, and assisting in creating description and access to digital archival materials.

This past May she graduated with a Master's in Archives and Public History, with a concentration in Archives, from New York University. While in the program, she worked at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives in the NYU Library. There, she split her time between processing and reference. Additionally, she worked with NYU's Digital Archivist on disk imaging and digital forensics for Tamiment's born digital collections. She is interested in digital preservation, personal digital archiving, and access to archives.
