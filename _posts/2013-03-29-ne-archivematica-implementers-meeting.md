It appears that adoption of Archivematica is really taking off. I&#8217;ve spoken to several other institutions, notably Yale and Columbia, who are not only planning to adopt the system, but also to contract with Artefactual for additional development. I thought it might be good to meet and discuss what we&#8217;re actually doing for a couple reasons, such as:

  1. To become more familiar with other institutions&#8217; use cases and workflows
  2. To prevent duplication of development efforts
  3. To provide feedback on development specifications, especially in order to generalize them for wider community use

I put together a call for Archivematica users in the north east region, and sent it out over various listserves. The response was pretty enthusiastic.

We&#8217;ll be having our inaugural meeting at the NYPL Library Services Center in Queens on April 12 from 2-4 PM. Arrive early (1 PM) if you&#8217;d like coffee and to check out the processing center or the forensic lab. The address is: 31-11 Thomson ave, Long Island City, NY 11101.

I&#8217;ll be posting more as things develop. Feel free to join us!
