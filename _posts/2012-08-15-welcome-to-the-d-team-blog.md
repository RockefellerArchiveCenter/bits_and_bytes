Hello Rockefeller Archive Center!

Welcome to the Digital Team (D-Team) blog. We’ve set up this blog  in order to provide an interactive forum for us to relay information to the rest of the RAC on the projects and tasks we’re working on. We’re hoping that the blog will serve as an educational resource not only for you, but for us as well, as we plan on documenting particular tasks that might not otherwise be captured as institutional memory. Please feel free to sign in and leave comments. We will be asking for guest postings too, as we work with you on various projects. Suggestions for the blog are always welcome!

Thank you,

Sibyl
