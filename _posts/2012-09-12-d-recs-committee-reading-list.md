Hi all,

Below is a list of resources I pulled together (with help from Laura) that should help guide discussion for our next meeting.

OAIS Resources

  1. [Blog post reviewing the basics](http://everybodyslibraries.com/2008/10/13/what-repositories-do-the-oais-model/) (good starting place)
  2. [Brian Lavoie, The OAIS Reference Model: Introductory Guide](http://www.dpconline.org/docs/lavoie_OAIS.pdf) [PDF]
  3. [PDF from DCCâ€™s Digital Curation 101 workshops](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/webfm_send/435). A bit on the technical side, but easy to use for reference.
  4. [Digital Preservation Management Workshop](http://www.dpworkshop.org/dpm-eng/foundation/oais/index.html). We may be using the questions listed for discussion during the meeting.

The following two resources are quite lengthy - please read the Introductions and areas that apply to your specific functional area (Appraisal, Description, etc) and browse the other sections.

  1. AIMS Survey: [Project Overview](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/whitepaper/) and [White Paper](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/whitepaper/AIMS_final.pdf)

  2. [Paradigm workbook on Digital Private Papers](http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/)
