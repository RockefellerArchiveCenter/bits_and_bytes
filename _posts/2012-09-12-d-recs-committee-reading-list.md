Hi all,

Below is a list of resources I pulled together (with help from Laura) that should help guide discussion for our next meeting.

OAIS Resources

  1. <a href="http://everybodyslibraries.com/2008/10/13/what-repositories-do-the-oais-model/" target="_blank">Blog post reviewing the basics</a> [good starting place]
  2. <a href="http://www.dpconline.org/docs/lavoie_OAIS.pdf" target="_blank">Brian Lavoie, The OAIS Reference Model: Introductory Guide [PDF]</a>
  3. <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/webfm_send/435" target="_blank">PDF from DCCâ€™s Digital Curation 101 workshops</a>. A bit on the technical side, but easy to use for reference.
  4. <a href="http://www.dpworkshop.org/dpm-eng/foundation/oais/index.html" target="_blank">Digital Preservation Management Workshop</a>. We may be using the questions listed for discussion during the meeting.

The following two resources are quite lengthy &#8211; please read the Introductions and areas that apply to your specific functional area (Appraisal, Description, etc) and browse the other sections.

  1. AIMS Survey: <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/whitepaper/" target="_blank"><br /> Project Overview</a>
  
    <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/whitepaper/AIMS_final.pdf" target="_blank">White Paper [PDF]</a>
  2. <a href="http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/" target="_blank">Paradigm workbook on Digital Private Papers</a>
