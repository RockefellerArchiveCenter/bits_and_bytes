I’ve now worked at the RAC for eleven years, which is long enough that several processes that I helped to define 
and put into place need to be re-examined and completely overhauled. This has been a thought-provoking (and to be
honest, feelings-provoking) process, and has got me thinking a lot about what it means to acknowledge and deal 
with things that aren’t working.<!--more-->

On one level, this is a post about why change management is hard. Everything around us is changing at different 
speeds and in different ways. People, organizations, and things grow and decay on their own cycles, and correctly
reading the symptoms of change in each case requires a great deal of attention and specialized knowledge. And all 
the time, our individual human selves are changing too. 

But this is also a post about maintenance, specifically the maintenance of processes. Because change is everywhere
and all the time, processes must evolve as well. Without intentionality those changes can end up causing friction 
rather than enabling; they are often workarounds or tweaks that solve an immediate crisis but don’t prevent its 
reoccurrence because they don’t address the underlying problem.

Bob Clark, our Director of Archives, calls these kinds of accretions “barnacles”, which I like both because I’m into 
delightful maritime metaphors but also because it has a couple of important resonances. First, it helps us step away 
from the moral judgment that’s so often part of change; the new thing is good, and the old thing is bad; or this 
change was good, and that change was bad. Change is change. Second, it helps us understand that processes need to 
be regularly maintained. Boats need to be hauled out every couple of years to have the barnacles scraped off and a 
fresh coat of paint applied. Processes do too.

Over the past couple of years, the Digital Strategies team has invested a significant amount of time in figuring out 
how to be good at maintaining software systems: we’ve defined what maintenance work we need to do, figured out how 
often we need to do it, and put documentation and automation in place. We haven’t really taken the same approach to 
processes though, so I’ve been thinking about what it would take to do this work effectively. So far, I’ve got more 
questions than answers:
- What kind of methodologies and tools would help us here? Business process analysis is a whole discipline, but how 
  does it think about this question of maintenance? Are user experience/service design methodologies useful here? 
  Are diagrams and metrics the codebases and unit tests of process maintenance?
- How do we bake this maintenance work into processes? Do owners of processes also own their maintenance, or is the 
  maintenance specialized enough that it needs to be centrally managed?
- How often does process maintenance need to happen, and is it consistent across processes or depend on the kind of 
  process?

And finally, this is a post about debt forgiveness. At the Society of American Archivists conference in 2022, I had 
my mind blown by a presentation about “archival debt”, at term coined by Jillian Cuellar to describe “resources owed 
to address problematic legacy issues in an archival repository resulting from past practices, policies, and strategies 
that prioritized the protection and validation of institutions over democratic access and responsible stewardship.” 
Everyone who’s worked as an archivist has experience this debt in one form or another, and the panelists (their comments 
were [recently published in the Journal of Contemporary Archival Studies](https://elischolar.library.yale.edu/jcas/vol10/
iss1/8/)) argued that, as a profession we are being crushed by this debt and need to find ways to forgive it rather than
continue to attempt to negotiate with it. 

I’m finding this particularly poignant right now as I wrestle with past ideas or decisions that seemed so great at the 
time but have over time become ineffective or changed beyond recognition. If we’re going to forgive archival debt, we’ve 
got to be able to forgive ourselves, and that starts with the humility to admit that we make mistakes, as well as the 
will to move past that failure and try again. This is especially true for those of us in leadership positions in 
archives. 

In thinking about change, I often find myself coming back to the words Octavia Butler gives to her protagonist Lauren 
Oya Olamina in _Parable of the Sower_: “All that you touch you change. All that you change changes you. The only lasting 
truth is change.” There’s both a challenge and a comfort here: change is unavoidable, so we need to make our peace with 
it. At the same time, because change is everywhere and in everything, it’s not inherently good or bad. It just is.
