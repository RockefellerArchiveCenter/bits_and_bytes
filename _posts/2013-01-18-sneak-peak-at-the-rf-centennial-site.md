You've been hearing about this project for years, here's your chance to finally see it! It's not officially published yet - that's happening in early Feb. In the meantime, [take a look.](http://69.164.218.34/)

A few things to note: not all sections are done; Human Ecology, Urbanization, and Computer Science are still in the works. Likewise, several sections lack media lists - the list of related documents that runs down the side of the essay pages. There are also still a few functionality tweaks here and there that need to be completed.

Feedback is welcome! Please send an email to Teresa if you'd like to make any comments.
