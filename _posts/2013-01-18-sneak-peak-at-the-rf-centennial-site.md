You&#8217;ve been hearing about this project for years, here&#8217;s your chance to finally see it! It&#8217;s not officially published yet &#8211; that&#8217;s happening in early Feb. In the meantime, [take a look.](http://69.164.218.34/) 

A few things to note: not all sections are done; Human Ecology, Urbanization, and Computer Science are still in the works. Likewise, several sections lack media lists &#8211; the list of related documents that runs down the side of the essay pages. There are also still a few functionality tweaks here and there that need to be completed. 

Feedback is welcome! Please send an email to Teresa if you&#8217;d like to make any comments.
