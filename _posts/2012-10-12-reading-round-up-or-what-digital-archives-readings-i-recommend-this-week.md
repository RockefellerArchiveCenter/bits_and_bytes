Part of my job is being up-to-date on the latest happenings in technology and digital archiving. In my attempts to accomplish this (one can never be truly up-to-date; there&#8217;s always some new information out there) I tend to browse through many, many, many, publications, blog postings, presentations, videos, etc. each week. Some are gems, some reinforce knowledge I already had, some introduce new technologies, and some make you wonder why the author bothered. Thankfully that last category isn&#8217;t very numerous! Below are articles from the past couple weeks which I&#8217;d recommend. I&#8217;m listing these partly to spread the knowledge through the RAC, and partly to create a running bibliography of texts from which we can form discussions, or refer to when questions like &#8220;What did that project do?&#8221; or &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there some article on a program that did that well?&#8221; come up. Please feel free to leave feedback or responses to the texts in the comments.<!--more-->

[<img class="alignleft" src="http://journal.code4lib.org/wp-content/themes/c4lj/images/logo.png" alt="Code4Lib Journal" />](http://journal.code4lib.org/)The folks over at Princeton discuss the design of their new finding aid website, in [Prototyping as a Process for Improved User Experience with Library and Archives Websites](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/7394). I really like their design and hope that we can implement some of it&#8217;s features in our own finding aid system. I&#8217;m hoping to spend some time reviewing how they&#8217;re handling digital objects in their system.

[Media Archaeology and Digital Stewardship: An interview with Lori Emerson](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2012/10/media-archaeology-and-digital-stewardship-an-interview-with-lori-emerson/) The Library of Congress digital preservation blog, [The Signal](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/) always provides top-notch content, and this interview is no different. I got a bit sidetracked by the digital poems they mentioned &#8211; [First Screenings](http://vispo.com/bp/) &#8211; which are not only AWESOMESAUCE but also highlight the importance of emulation (and also made me relieved that most of our digital records are nice, standard, non-emulating-needing institutional records).

Today is the [Day of Digital Archives, 2012!![Day of Digital Archives](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MGtNZQcO3I8/UClY5KZi8xI/AAAAAAAAAKY/ctMdvfkoJGU/s1600/header13.jpg)](http://dayofdigitalarchives.blogspot.com/)

Lastly, the resources provided by the University of Michigan&#8217;s repository, Deep Blue, are not exactly new, but are an excellent resource for [digital format information](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/about/deepbluepreservation.jsp). I&#8217;m especially excited about the Best Practice guides they provide for creating [PDFs](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/58005),  [office documents](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/40245/1/MicrosoftOffice-Best_Practice.pdf), [images](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/40247/1/Images-Best_Practice.pdf), [audio](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/40248/1/Audio-Best_Practice.pdf), and [video.](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/83222)
