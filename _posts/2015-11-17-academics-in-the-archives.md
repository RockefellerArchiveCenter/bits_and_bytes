Our very smart and articulate colleague [Rachel Wimpee](https://twitter.com/craftyrachel), who works in our Research and Education division, has published a post on [MLA's Connected Academics blog](https://connect.commons.mla.org/alt-ac-in-the-archives/) that talks about her work at the RAC, including the [Zotero bibliography project](http://blog.rockarch.org/?p=873) the Digital Program helped to organize. She also touches on larger issues of cross-disciplinary work and the enduring value of humanities education, so her post is well-worth a read!
