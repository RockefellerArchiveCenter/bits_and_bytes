## Notes

* Webinar will help:
  1. Provide a better understanding of storage requirements
  2. Provide a better understanding of useable metadata for long term storage

### Storage

### What are storage needs

* Manage content (files + metadata=objects) as objects
* Includes any type of content (images, text etc.)
* Need at least 2 copies of objects in at least two locations

### Well managed collections

* Basic information for each deposit
* Minimal metadata for objects
* Common (or normalized) file formats
* Controlled and known storage of content
* Multiple copies

### Importance of Metadata

* How do you know what the object is?
  * Metadata identifies the objects
* How do you use the content in the future?
  * Metadata makes the objects understandable
* How do you know the object is authentic
  * Metadata will allow you to trace the object over time
  * Metadata= Long term preservation

### Object level metadata

* PREMIS metadata=Preservation metadata=Administrative (Management), Structural (Understandable and useable) and Descriptive (findable and useable)
  * Content (What it is)
  * Fixity (Has the object changed)
  * Provenance (Audit trail, chain of custody)
  * Reference (Identified as this content)
  * Context- Preserve linkages with other objects

### Number of copies

* Minimum 2
* Optimum 6
* Example: Video files are too large to store 6 copies, possible legal restrictions on storage and locations

### Storage Media Options

* Content (objects) are kept on storage media
* Options include: online (networked PC), near-line (external hard drive), offline (DVD)
* Factors for choosing options include:
  * Cost: available resources for preservation
  * Quantity:Â  Number and size of files
  * Expertise: skills required to manage
  * Partners: archiving geographic distribution
  * Services: Outsourcing

### Storage Considerations

* Multiple, geographically distributed copies
* Storage partners
* Hosted services such as DURACLOUD
