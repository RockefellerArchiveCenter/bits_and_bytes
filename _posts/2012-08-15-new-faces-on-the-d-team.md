The D-Team has several new additions, and we want to introduce them to you.<!--more-->

## Hillel Arnold (Digital Archivist)

Hillel is primarily working on setting up the eXtensible Text Framework (or XTF), the new system for displaying our finding aids online. This system is the same that backs the [Online Archive of California](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/), [Virginia Heritage](http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/search), and other finding aid sites. Hillel is revising the default stylesheets to customize the finding aids display for the RAC, as well as ensuring that the system works in a way that meets the needs of researchers and archival staff. In the future, he will be integrating library records and digital objects into XTF as well.

## Jeff Destine (Consultant)

Jeff has been helping us out with server setup and optimization for our Linux-based systems, including XTF and Omeka (the system we're using to develop the website for the RF's Centennial). He is making sure these systems run quickly and smoothly, and are backed up so they can be restored should anything unexpected happen. He'll be helping us implement our digital preservation system, Archivematica, in late summer/early fall.

## Kate Mockler (Archival Support Staff)

Kate is working on digitizing material for the RF Centennial website and creating item-level descriptions for each digital object. She is also assisting in data cleanup tasks with our finding aids and library records as part of the process of migrating our description from Re:discovery to ATReference.

## Shelly Tremaglio (Summer Intern)

Shelly is working on building the RF Centennial website in Omeka, creating pages by adding digitized material as well as descriptive metadata. At the same time, she is working on cleaning up the metadata associated with these digital objects.
