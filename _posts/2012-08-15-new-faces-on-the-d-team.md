The D-Team has several new additions, and we want to introduce them to you.<!--more-->

**Hillel Arnold (Digital Archivist)**
  
[<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5" title="hillel" src="http://192.168.50.22/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/hillel-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](http://192.168.50.22/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/hillel.jpg)Hillel is primarily working on setting up the eXtensible Text Framework (or XTF), the new system for displaying our finding aids online. This system is the same that backs the <a href="http://www.oac.cdlib.org/" target="_blank">Online Archive of California</a>, <a href="http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/search" target="_blank">Virginia Heritage</a>, and other finding aid sites. Hillel is revising the default stylesheets to customize the finding aids display for the RAC, as well as ensuring that the system works in a way that meets the needs of researchers and archival staff. In the future, he will be integrating library records and digital objects into XTF as well.

He is making sure these systems run quickly and smoothly, and are backed up so they can be restored should anything unexpected happen. He’ll be helping us implement our digital preservation system, Archivematica, in late summer/early fall.
