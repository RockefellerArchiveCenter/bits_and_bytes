At the recent [Society of American Archivists](http://www2.archivists.org/) [annual conference](http://www2.archivists.org/2014#.VCmiFSldW4Q), I was fortunate enough to present as [part of a panel](http://www2.archivists.org/2014/schedule#.VCmFCildW4Q) discussing the application of digital forensics in an archival setting. I touched on the work I've been doing with the D-Recs committee and on developing the forensics workflows [that I've discussed previously](http://rockarch.org/programs/digital/bitsandbytes/?p=1117). My co-presenters, Cal Lee, Don Mennerich, and Christie Peterson, discussed different aspects related to digital forensics in archives, from learning forensics techniques to an overview of current research in the field. I highly recommend checking out the audio for the session, which is available on our shared drive.

As a result of my presentation, I was asked [to do an interview](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2014/09/were-all-digital-archivists-now-an-interview-with-sibyl-schaefer/) with [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/) for [The Signal](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/), the Library of Congress blog on digital preservation. [The interview](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2014/09/were-all-digital-archivists-now-an-interview-with-sibyl-schaefer) went live last week and touches on some points I made during my presentation as well as current and future D-Team projects. I hope you enjoy it!
