If, like me, you missed out on yesterday's webinar from OCLC Research titled "Achieving Thresholds for Discovery: Addressing Issues with EAD to Increase Discovery and Access," you can now view a [recording of the presentation](https://oclc.webex.com/oclc/lsr.php?AT=pb&SP=EC&rID=66315737&rKey=ea8f79b63eb82cee). It's worth your time to listen to Merrilee Proffitt (OCLC Research) talk about her [recent article on EAD tag analysis](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8956) in the Code4Lib Journal, and also to listen to Dan Santamaria (Princeton University) talk about the work of his institution's [Archival Description Working Group](http://www2.archivists.org/node/17731) in improving their archival description as well as their [discovery system for archival materials](http://findingaids.princeton.edu/). A few months back, I [wrote about a presentation](http://rockarch.org/programs/digital/bitsandbytes/?p=741) that Dan and others from Princeton gave at SAA this past August, and found that this webinar nicely complemented that earlier presentation.
