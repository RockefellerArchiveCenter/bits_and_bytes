Last week I attended the Radcliffe Workshop on Technology and Archival Processing. It was a really amazing event that brought together archivists, historians, librarians, digital humanists, technologists, and others to discuss the relationship between technology, archival processing and digital humanities. The talks were thought-provoking and introduced new ideas and methods I hadn't considered before. One talk that really stood out to me was Jarrett M. Drake's reconsideration of archival principles including provenance and _respect des fonds_. It brought up similar themes to those we discussed in the [RAC reading group](http://blog.rockarch.org/?p=1468) last month that focused on the concept of original order. Fortunately, it's now [available online](https://medium.com/on-archivy/radtech-meets-radarch-towards-a-new-principle-for-archives-and-archival-description-568f133e4325#.ioxxjj7vi); it's a really worthwhile read, especially in light of our conversations around _respect des fonds_ a few weeks ago.
